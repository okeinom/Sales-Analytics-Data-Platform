# Sales Analytics Data Platform

## Business Problem
This project implements an end-to-end **batch data pipeline** for retail analytics.

The goal is to ingest transactional sales data, transform it into analytics-ready tables, and support **historical analysis** of customer and product performance.

The platform is designed to reflect real-world data engineering patterns, including raw data ingestion, staged transformations, dimensional modeling, and historical tracking of changes.

## Data Pipeline Flow

Source → Raw → Staging → Analytics


### Source
- CSV files representing retail entities:
  - customers
  - customer updates
  - products
  - stores
  - sales transactions

### Raw
- Data stored **as-is**
- No transformations applied
- Preserves source fidelity for auditing and reprocessing

### Staging
- Data cleaned and typed
- Business keys validated
- Prepared for analytical modeling

### Analytics
- Modeled into a **star schema**
- Optimized for analytical queries

---

## Data Model

### Fact Table
**fact_sales**
- sale_id  
- customer_id  
- product_id  
- store_id  
- sale_timestamp  
- quantity  
- revenue  

### Dimension Tables
- **dim_customer** (Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2)
- dim_product
- dim_store
- dim_date

---

## Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD Type 2)

Customer attributes such as email and loyalty tier can change over time.

To preserve historical accuracy, the `dim_customer` table implements **SCD Type 2** using:
- customer_id (business key)
- effective_start_date
- effective_end_date
- is_current

When a customer attribute changes, a new row is created while the previous version is expired.  
This allows accurate historical reporting without overwriting past data.

## How to Run

### 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate
2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Generate synthetic source data
bash
Copy code
python scripts/generate_data.py
CSV files will be created in data/raw/.

Notes
The dataset is synthetic by design to allow controlled simulation of customer changes for SCD Type 2.

The focus of this project is data engineering architecture and transformation logic, not visualization.
